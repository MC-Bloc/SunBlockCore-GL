# Displaying Server Stats 

* CPU Temperature is read directly from the system. Keep in mind that the file it reads from exists in a series of SymLinks so it might be that the `Thermal_Zone` folder name might change. This happened just now and caused the mod to crash after cloning a drive. Leaving this note here for future reference.  
* The server reads the stats from the `JSON` file produced from this python script.
* This file contains 11 readings namely:
  1. `Timestamp`,
  2. `PVVoltage`,
  3. `PVCurrent`,
  4. `PVPower`,
  5. `BattVoltage`,
  6. `BattChargeCurrent`,
  7. `BattChargePower`,
  8. `LoadPower`,
  9. `BattPercentage`,
  10. `BattOverallCurrent`,
  11. `CPUPowerDraw`.
* These readings are read by the modpack in the file [DataQueryProcess.java](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/services/DataQueryProcess.java).
* This file reads and parses the data for each reading, and each of them has a wrapper `GET` function.
* Each of these functions is called by the [ServerSetup.java](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/services/setup/ServerSetup.java) file. This file refreshes these readings every second.
* After reading these values, they are used as the constructor values for a `ServerDataS2CPacket` object. (This object is defined [here](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/application/network/packets/ServerDataS2CPacket.java))
* The `ServerDataS2CPacket` object is sent over to the Client via the [ModPackets.SendToClient(...)](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/application/network/ModPackets.java) method.
* On the client side, the `ServerDataS2CPacket` sets the static class values in the [SolarServerData](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/domain/SolarServerData.java) object.
* The `SolarServerData` Object is contained within the [ClientSetup](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/services/setup/ClientSetup.java) file.
* The [ClientEventHandler](../src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/application/client/ClientEventHandler.java) uses the `SolarServerData` object from the `ClientSetup` object, to get all these values and render them on the HUD.
