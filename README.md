# Solar Powered Minecraft
Version `0.7.0-1.20.1`



SunBlock is a research project at Concordia University Montreal, under the supervision of Dr. Bart 
Simon & Dr. Darren Wershler. Find more at the project [homepage](https://minecraftbloc.milieux.ca/sunblock). 

The project is exploring alternate minecraft game mechanics and play-styles when integrating 
Real-Time Solar and Power usage data into the minecraft world. 

SunBlockCore is a forge mod that, on the server-side loads up real-time solar data into minecraft, altering the game 
and broadcasting it live to users that recieve it on the client-side and play along the material conditions of the server. 

Please see the [docs folder](./docs/) for more documentation.

## Getting Started 
- Clone the repository and open a terminal in the root directory of the project.
- Run `./gradlew build` to fetch and compile Gradle. This should output `Build Successful`. 
- Run `./gradlew runClient` to compile the source code and run it in Minecraft.

## Running The Mod: 
- For the JAR file, please see [releases](https://github.com/MC-Bloc/SB1-DataVisMod/releases).

7. Back in CurseForge, Click `Play` to launch the modpack. 

8. Once the game is loaded, choose `Multiplayer` in the main menu. Click `Add Server` and enter the server's IP address, follower by :25565 

## The So Far...
The mod is set up to display server data on a heads-up display (HUD). 

The CPU temperature values are fetched from the command line on the server side (see how this is done [here](https://github.com/MC-Bloc/SB1-DataVisMod/blob/main/src/main/java/ca/milieux/sunblock/sunblockcore/services/DataQueryProcess.java)). 

The rest of the values related to the Solar server setup (voltages, powers, and currents from PV panel and battery as well as battery remaining) are 
all fetched from the JSON file being generated by the python script [serialread.py](https://github.com/Solar-Minecraft-Project/solar_server/blob/main/SerialRead/serialread.py).
