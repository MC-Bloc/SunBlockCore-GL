# SunBlockCore 
Version `0.7.0-1.20.1`

SunBlockCore is a forge mod for the [SunBlock](https://github.com/MC-Bloc/SunBlock) system, 
It loads up real-time solar data on the server-side into Minecraft and broadcasts it live to users that recieve it on 
the client-side, enabling new game mechanics for a solar-powered survival multiplayer experience.  

For the mod file (JAR), please see [releases](https://github.com/MC-Bloc/SB1-DataVisMod/releases).

> :warning: The naming and versioning for the mod was changed after `solarminecraft-1.0.6` to be consistent with the fact
that the mod is still in its pre-release state. Also the mod's name was formalized as SunBlockCore.

Please see the [docs](./docs/) for more technical information.
